# Professional Portfolio

The challenge was to make my own webpage showcasing my work and projects. As well as a Bio and my contact information for anybody that would like to reach out. 

## Description

With my limited knowledge, I relied heavily on the past lessons and examples given to me. I initially started with runbuddy. I took out the meat of the code and was left with the skeleton. This included the overall layout of the nav, header, and body. I began with my color scheme. By reaserching colors, I was able to find a few schemes that seem to work. I am unfourtunantly colorblind so having the online resources helped. I then proceeded to outline my nav bar. I inserted the title of my website and the tabs I planned on using. After that I worked on my header. This simply included a "looput for updates" message and a link to my LinkedIn. I then started with sectioning off my sections. My bio was up first. I wanted my picture and Bio to be side by side as much as possible as I thought that was aesthetically pleasing. However as that would be tough for mobile I had to change that later on in CSS for mobile compatibility. Next it was my "products". Since I have very few to showcase, the instructions said to "make them up". I instead used some lessons from the modules as placeholders. Sectioning them off so that the first project was larger turned out to be more difficult than I thought, however it worked out in the end. The contact form had alot of inspiration from Run Buddy. I was a big fan of the form use, so I decided to have an area where you could tell me your name and a message so that I could recieve it straight from the web page and not have to trouble people with sending an email. I did include my email, phone and address if someone would like to send a more personalized message. After that it was on to formatting for smaller screens with alot of flexbos and diplay changes so that the content would stack. after that it was just making sure all my links worked, added some hover attributes, and debugged before submitting.
